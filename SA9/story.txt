START| LEFT_SEA, STRAIGHT_WOODS, RIGHT_CASTLE| You are traveling along a path on a cold, winter evening, when you come to a fork in the road. Do you a) head left towards the sea, b) head straight through the woods, or c) head right towards the castle?
RIGHT_CASTLE| ENTER, R_CONTINUE_ON| You head up the steep path towards the castle. You are cold, and night is falling. As you approach the castle, you notice that some of the lights are still on, and the front portcullis is not lowered. Do you a) stop to rest for the night or b) continue on your journey?
ENTER| DRINK, DONT_DRINK| You choose to stop and rest for the night. The castle guards let you in, and the resident Duke and Ducchess provide you a warm welcome. They set you up in a grand room in the castle and provide you with supper. Before you head to sleep, you are offered a goblet of an unknown shimmering liquid. The servant claims it is offered to all of the guests, and that it will help you sleep well. Do you a) drink the goblet or b) kindly refuse and go to bed?
DRINK|| You choose to drink the shimmering liquid in the goblet. It puts you to sleep, just like the servant said. You never wake up. The end.
DONT_DRINK|| You refuse to drink the shimmering liquid in the goblet. Wise choice. Although you toss and turn all night, you awake in the morning and continue on your journey. You reach your destination safely. The end.
R_CONTINUE_ON|| You choose to continue on your journey. Up in the high mountains surround the castle, it is much colder than it would have been in the woods or by the ocean. You have gotten no food, or rest. You are quite stupid. As the wind picks up, you freeze to death. The end.
STRAIGHT_WOODS| CAMPFIRE, S_CONTINUE_ON| You head straight through the woods. You are cold, and night is falling. As you trek through the snow, you notice a campfire a little ways off the road. Do you a) leave the main road to head towards the campfire or b) continue on your journey?
CAMPFIRE|| You choose to leave the main road to head towards the campfire. What a stupid thing to do. The campfire is a trap, set by man-eating trolls to lure the weary passenger to a cannibalistic death. You get eaten. The end.
S_CONTINUE_ON|| You choose to continue on your journey. Although the night is cold and you are hungry and get no food or rest, you reach your destination safely. The end.
LEFT_SEA| INVESTIGATE, L_CONTINUE_ON| You head left towards the sea. After a few hours, darkness settles. As you continue along the windblown-cliffs, a mysterious light appears in the distance. Do you a) go off to investigate or b) continue on your journey?
INVESTIGATE| TOUCH, TURN_BACK| You choose to leave the path to investigate the mysterious light. As you approach it, you notice that it is actually an incredibly large swirling, pulsating, mass of colours. Do you a) attempt to touch it or b) turn back towards your path?
TOUCH|| You choose to touch the swirling mass. You are so stupid. The mass is actually a portal, and you get sucked in, traveling to an unknown land. The end.
TURN_BACK|| You choose to turn back towards your path. Wise choice. Although the night is cold and you are hungry and get no food or rest, you reach your destination safely. The end.
L_CONTINUE_ON|| You choose to continue on your journey. Although the night is cold and you are hungry and get no food or rest, you reach your destination safely. The end.
